# TransGAN-CFR
IEEE_TGRS

Since the source code is being refactored and involved in our subsequent work, we will gradually make the editable code public as the relevent works are published.

The data and weights used can be downloaded here:

Link：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1cX0a8QQrSsU-UmWDKgIJ9A 

Extraction code：gpft

Extract the downloaded folder

Put data folder 'data' and trained weights 'gen_model.pth' to the directory at the same level as pytransform

Configure the environment according to 'environment.yaml' and 'requirements.txt'

Run 'pre_evaluation.py'

**Update:**
Folder 'modelopen' consists the editable code of generative network and the discriminative network.
